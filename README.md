**Da**vs **L**et's **S**pl**i**t **K**eyboard firmware for atmega32u4

### Why
Just for fun :) I made this to see if I can do it and to learn. The list of features is kept to minimal, so the code would be simple:

* Update the keymap without reflashing the atmega32u4 (keymap is kept in EEPROM)
* Layers
* DualKey - tap for standard key, hold with other key for modifier (like CTRL+ESC on a single key)
* Designed for the [Let's Split](https://github.com/nicinabox/lets-split-guide) keyboard by [wootpatoot](https://www.reddit.com/user/wootpatoot)
* Split keyboard support via I2C

### Inspired by

* [Animus firmware](https://github.com/blahlicus/animus-family)
* [QMK](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware)
