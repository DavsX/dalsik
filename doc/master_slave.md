The Let's Split keyboard consists of two halves:

* master
* slave

The master half is the one, which is connected via an USB cable with the computer. This half is responsible to report the key press/release events to the operating system. The slave half is responsible for scanning its own key matrix and for reporting any changes to the master via the TRRS cable.
